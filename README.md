# How to use

<b>Suggestion: It is better to add by ID because if you add by username only users having usernames will be added. Moreover, it is slow</b>

* Install Requirements

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Read the complete tutorial `HOW_TO_USE.txt` and use it

* Add your accounts to add and scrape members

`python manager.py`

# Note

Sometimes users may not get added at all, this may be because the account is probably limited. Try with another account
